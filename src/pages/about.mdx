# Hi, I'm Amy.

## I'm a multidisciplinary designer & developer from California. My superpowers are in speculative and multimodal design. I love dry humor, tinkering, and an ice-cold matcha latte. I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's in Psychology ('24) and a master's in Computer Science ('25) at Stanford University. This summer, I will returning as a UX Design intern @ Amazon.

## I love a good puzzle. 

### Wherever there’s an interesting problem to solve, I’ll go – whether that means deciphering complex algorithms, painting a North Star vision, or imagining end-to-end user experiences. I pull inspiration from an unconventional background in game design, neuroscience, and engineering. I know what it takes to put the pieces together. I thrive building scrappy and building at scale. I’m passionate about grounding my work in the psychology of everyday people. I currently help teach graduate-level classes on game design and designing for behavior change.
