### “Groove n’ Bloom” is a beat sequencer inspired by my love of gardening. Over the last quarter, I have slowly been amassing a small army of plants (now close to 20) in my dorm room by my windowsill. The wonder and peace I experienced just by seeing my plants make little progress, day by day, inspired me to keep going myself. Simply put, my beat sequencer models the growth cycle of a typical plant. To remove sound from the world is to kill the plant. To grow the plant is to change its sound. 

#### Tools Used: ChuCK, ChuGL (audiovisual programming software)

#### Duration: 2 weeks
