### Key Features:

- Stylized garden scene featuring a pond with lily pads and a cherry blossom tree.
- Utilization of Blender Cycles rendering engine to achieve desired visual effects.
- Integration of various Blender/Cycles features including volumetric emission, depth of field, motion blur, and denoising.
- Hand-crafted 3D models for assets such as trees, bridges, stones, and water surfaces.
- Custom and procedural textures created using Adobe Photoshop and Blender's built-in tools.

### My role: 
- Procedural material creation for water and stone surfaces.
- Lighting setup and sky implementation.
- Development of emitter systems for floating petals.
- Denoising and final scene refinement.

### Tools Used:
- Blender Cycles rendering engine.
- Adobe Photoshop for texture creation and editing.
- Adobe Illustrator for petal image creation.
- Various Blender modeling and texturing tools.
