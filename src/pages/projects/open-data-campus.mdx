### I built the Open Data Campus website for Stanford and Northwestern's open data student organizations. The website features snap scrolling for six chapters of content on harnessing open data on college campuses. This was also one of my very first web dev projects!

#### Tools Used: Bootstrap, HTML, CSS

#### Duration: 3 weeks
